Taxi Booking System

Application Overview
This project’s primary objective was to develop a system that can be used by the users to gain cab services, additionally, the application offers rental options which widens the scope of availability among users. 

Problem Statement
We live in the 21st century, a time where we have compact furnished houses with no parking spaces anywhere close by. Lack of parking space means increase in individual commute using public transportation. This opens up a market for commercial transportation providers – in this case Taxis. There will always be a need for additional taxis or cars at rent. And also, because for the purpose of this project I have received the assigned application of Taxi Booking Systems for the subject and implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms. 

Problem Solution
To provide solution for the above mentioned problem statement, I would say that a taxi booking application would provide the necessary features and services the customer demand of. Developing this application can help out the service providing company a lot of profitability and respectability in the market for fulfilling public demand and earning. This assignment was issued by the tutor as a problem statement, we will be accessed on the basis of the logic code that we provide. 

Modules
Imported required libraries into the code for easier workflow. Imports such as Scanner.util, text.parseException, SimpleDateFormat, and of course the default libraries imported by the IDE which includes as chosen by the user when installing it in the system, everything from java.base to java.sql. so first I devised a development plan stating how will I develop the application, how will I add functionalities. Then I designed the system architecture for the same. Since the complexity wasn’t that much, I did not make an algorithm before I started my development phase. Then I started off with creating the project file in IDE, created classes and inherited a subclass from the dashboard.java to avoid chaos and confusion. Then I made sure I had all the requirements checked out for the application and tested it, and displayed it to the tutor for further review and changes.

Software Requirements
For the development of this application. I used Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Developers. Additionally, I used Lucid Charts for the UML diagrams and for the system architecture. 

Execution steps: Open the application in your IDE and run the Dashboard.java file. The application will run in the console. you will see three service options available for taxi booking. Choosing any of them will guide to a new options for entering necessary details for your taxi ride. You will be asked a few questions after which you will recieve the confirmation of your input. You can end the program by closing the console.
